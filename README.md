The project is to do research that how many people are suffering from depression. The app will be used to find whether there are chances that the user is suffering from depression or not and if he is, then he should consult a professional for help. The app uses ResearchKit, which was introduced by Apple in 2015 and is used to connect developers with researchers. Since then many applications have been developed which make use of ResearchKit in conducting different types of researches like fitness level and blood sugar level among people of different age groups etc. which can be very beneficial to reduce some of the health problems caused by these by creating awareness among people.

In this project or app, the modules of ResearchKit are implemented which involves the user giving his consent to use his data for research purposes and taking part in a survey consisting of different questions which are of different steps that is the question step and the form step. The questions consist of multiple choice or the rating questions in which the user will give rating from for e.g. 1 â€“ 6 using the slider which will be provided in the app itself.
